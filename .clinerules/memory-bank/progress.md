# Progress: NBA Sports Analytics Platform

## Overall Status

*   Project Initiated.
*   Currently setting up **Backend Foundation (Agno)**, part of Phase 1.

## Completed Tasks

*   [2025-04-04] Initial project planning and documentation strategy defined.
*   [2025-04-04] Created initial Memory Bank files (`productContext.md`, `techContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `progress.md`, `activeContext.md`).
*   [2025-04-04] Created initial `cline_docs` files (`projectRoadmap.md`, `currentTask.md`, `techStack.md`, `codebaseSummary.md`).
*   [2025-04-04] Created Next.js frontend project (`nba-analytics-frontend`) using `create-next-app`.
*   [2025-04-04] Initialized `shadcn/ui` in the frontend project.
*   [2025-04-04] Added `button` component via `shadcn/ui` to verify frontend integration.
*   [2025-04-04] Created backend directory (`nba-analytics-backend`).
*   [2025-04-04] Initialized Python virtual environment (`.venv`) in backend.
*   [2025-04-04] Installed core backend dependencies (`agno`, `fastapi`, etc.).
*   [2025-04-04] Created initial backend files (`main.py`, `agents.py`, `.env`, `.gitignore`, `requirements.txt`).
*   [2025-04-04] Defined initial Agno agents (`DataAggregator`, `DataNormalizer`, `AnalysisAgent`) in `agents.py`.
*   [2025-04-04] Configured `AnalysisAgent` with Gemini (`gemini-1.5-flash`) and loaded API key from `.env`.
*   [2025-04-04] Updated FastAPI endpoints (`/analyze`, `/fetch_data`, `/normalize_data`) in `main.py` with Pydantic models.
*   [2025-04-04] Added basic tests for FastAPI endpoints in `test_main.py` using `TestClient`.
*   [2025-04-04] Committed initial agent and API setup (d1cd90e).
*   [2025-04-04] Refactored tool logic into `api_tools/` directory.
*   [2025-04-04] Added tools: `get_player_gamelog`, `get_team_info_and_roster`, `get_player_career_stats`.
*   [2025-04-04] Added `nba-api` dependency and `pytest.ini`.
*   [2025-04-04] Created `app.py` client script for manual testing.
*   [2025-04-04] Committed tool additions and refactoring (cdbf70b).
*   [2025-04-04] Debugged agent response handling, `playercareerstats` params, async errors. Implemented JSON extraction workarounds in `main.py`. Committed fixes (bd0cceda).
*   [2025-04-04] Added `find_games` tool (using `leaguegamefinder`, limited results).
*   [2025-04-04] Implemented `NBAnalysisTeam` in `teams.py` to coordinate agents.
*   [2025-04-04] Updated agent instructions for team workflow and JSON extraction.
*   [2025-04-04] Updated `app.py` to test team workflow. Committed team implementation (7ac25a49).

## Current Focus

*   Adding more data fetching tools (e.g., box scores, scoreboard).
*   Refining agent instructions and team workflow.
*   Investigating remaining known issues (pytest async, per_mode).

## What Works

*   Memory Bank documentation structure established.
*   Basic Next.js project structure created in `nba-analytics-frontend`.
*   `shadcn/ui` successfully initialized and integrated in frontend.
*   Basic Python backend structure created in `nba-analytics-backend`.
*   Initial Agno agent definitions exist (`agents.py`).
*   Basic FastAPI endpoints defined (`main.py`). `/analyze` uses agent, `/fetch_data` uses agent with history extraction workaround.
*   Gemini API key configured.
*   Agents defined: `DataAggregatorAgent`, `AnalysisAgent`, `NBAnalysisTeam`.
*   Tools implemented: `get_player_info`, `get_player_gamelog`, `get_player_career_stats`, `get_team_info_and_roster`, `find_games` (limited results).
*   Tool logic modularized in `api_tools/`.
*   `app.py` client tests the `NBAnalysisTeam` workflow directly.
*   `main.py` includes workarounds for agent JSON response extraction.
*   `teams.py` defines the multi-agent workflow.

## Known Issues / Blockers
*   **Agent Response Wrapping:** `DataAggregatorAgent` wraps tool JSON output internally, requiring extraction logic in `main.py` / `app.py`. This extraction logic is complex and might be fragile.
*   **`pytest` Async Errors:** Running agent workflows via FastAPI endpoints within `pytest` still causes `Event loop is closed` errors. Direct agent testing via `app.py` is the current verification method.
*   **`playercareerstats` `per_mode`:** Tool currently ignores `per_mode36` parameter due to `nba_api` issues; fetches default stats only. Needs further investigation.
*   **`find_games` Filters:** Tool signature simplified (removed season/type/league filters) due to API schema validation errors.
*   **Token Limits:** Large tool outputs (like many games from `find_games`) can exceed the context window when passed between agents in the team workflow. `find_games` results are currently limited as a workaround.

## What's Left to Build (High Level)

*   **Phase 1:**
    *   [X] Complete Next.js + shadcn/ui setup.
    *   [~] Set up basic Agno backend structure (Agents defined, API endpoints basic).
    *   [ ] Integrate basic data APIs (using mock data initially, likely via backend agents).
    *   Build caching layer prototype.
    *   Normalize data formats (prototype).
    *   Prototype core UI components (e.g., Court Map, Player Comparison).
*   **Phase 2:** AI Analysis Layer (Design prompts, implement client-side runtime).
*   **Phase 3:** Frontend Experience (Build out all core features and visualizations).
*   **Future:** Community features, AR, Fantasy integration.
