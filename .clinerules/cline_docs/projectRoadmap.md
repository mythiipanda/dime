# Project Roadmap: NBA Sports Analytics Platform

## Project Goals

*   [ ] Provide free, professional-grade NBA analytics tools.
*   [ ] Enable real-time, data-driven decision support for fans/analysts.
*   [ ] Create an intuitive and visually compelling user interface.
*   [ ] Integrate AI for deeper insights and predictions.

## Implementation Phases

*   **Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Current)**
    *   [X] Initial Project Setup (Next.js + shadcn/ui)
    *   [~] Set up basic Agno backend structure (Agents defined, API endpoints basic)
    *   [ ] Integrate free NBA data APIs (mock data first, via backend)
    *   [ ] Build basic caching layer (backend)
    *   [ ] Normalize data formats (backend - `DataNormalizerAgent` defined but commented out).
    *   [ ] Prototype core UI components (Court Map, Comparison Matrix) (Frontend - Paused)
*   **Phase 2: AI Analysis Layer**
    *   [ ] Design prompts for AI (e.g., Gemini)
    *   [ ] Implement client-side AI runtime
    *   [ ] Integrate AI insights into UI
*   **Phase 3: Frontend Experience Enhancement**
    *   [ ] Build out all core features (Team DNA, Live Mode, Trade Machine, Draft Sim, Trend Forecaster)
    *   [ ] Refine visualizations (D3, Three.js, etc.)
    *   [ ] Implement user experience priorities (One-Click Insights, Tutorials, Shareability)

## Key Features (Target)

*   Team DNA Analysis
*   Live Game Mode
*   Trade Machine
*   Draft Simulator
*   Trend Forecaster
*   Interactive Court Map
*   Player Comparison Matrix
*   Dynamic Timeline

## Completion Criteria (Overall)

*   All core features implemented and functional.
*   Data APIs integrated and handling rate limits gracefully.
*   AI insights are relevant and integrated smoothly.
*   UI is intuitive, responsive, and visually appealing.
*   Basic test coverage achieved.
*   User acceptance testing feedback addressed.
